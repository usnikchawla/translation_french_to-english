# NeuralLingo: Advanced French-to-English Neural Translation

## Project Overview
NeuralLingo is a cutting-edge machine translation project that leverages the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with an encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanism to translate French text to English.

## Features
- RNN encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism
- Optimized for French to English translation
- Configurable parameters in `main.py`
- Comprehensive data processing and model training pipeline

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/NeuralLingo.git
   cd NeuralLingo
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Configure the model parameters in `main.py`
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Model Architecture
The project implements an RNN encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism, which has shown impressive results in sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.

## Data
The `data/` directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Ensure you have the necessary French-English parallel corpus in this directory.

## Results
After training, the model's performance metrics and generated translations can be found in the `results/` directory.
